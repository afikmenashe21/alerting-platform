# Memory Bank usage (global + service-aware)

## At the start of every task

1) Always read the global Memory Bank (if it exists):
- memory-bank/projectbrief.md
- memory-bank/techContext.md
- memory-bank/systemPatterns.md
- memory-bank/activeContext.md
- memory-bank/progress.md

2) If the current file/task is inside a service directory
   (e.g. services/<service-name>/):

- Also read the service-level Memory Bank (if it exists):
  - services/<service-name>/memory-bank/techContext.md
  - services/<service-name>/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md
  - services/<service-name>/memory-bank/progress.md

Do NOT assume a service Memory Bank exists — read it only if present.

## While working

- Follow global systemPatterns and techContext unless explicitly overridden
  by the service-level Memory Bank.
- Service-level Memory Bank takes precedence for service-specific decisions.
- If information is missing or unclear, propose an update to the appropriate
  Memory Bank (global or service-level).

## At the end of completing a task

1) Always update:
- memory-bank/activeContext.md  
  (current focus, next steps, cross-service implications)
- memory-bank/progress.md  
  (global decisions, shared changes, milestones)

2) If the task affected a specific service:
- Update that service’s:
  - services/<service-name>/memory-bank/progress.md
    (service-specific changes, decisions, constraints)

Only write stable, long-lived knowledge.
Do NOT add temporary notes, debugging output, or speculative ideas.
