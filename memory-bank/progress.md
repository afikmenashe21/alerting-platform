# Alerting Platform – Progress

## Decisions made
- Kafka for replay + at-least-once.
- Postgres for control-plane + notification idempotency boundary.
- Redis snapshot for evaluator warmup.
- Event contracts defined in protobuf (`proto/*.proto` + `pkg/proto`).

## Milestones
- [x] Topic contracts finalized (protobuf messages + sample payloads)
- [x] Postgres migrations: clients/rules (rule-service)
- [x] rule-service: CRUD + publish rule.changed
- [x] rule-updater: rebuild snapshot → Redis + bump version
- [x] evaluator: warmup + match + publish alerts.matched (one message per client_id)
- [x] aggregator: dedupe insert + publish notifications.ready
- [x] sender: consume notifications.ready + send via email (SMTP), Slack (webhook API), and webhook (HTTP POST) + update status
- [x] alert-producer: generate alerts + load tests
- [x] rule-service-ui: React UI for CRUD operations on clients, rules, and endpoints

## Code health
- [x] rule-service: comprehensive code cleanup and modularization:
  - Removed redundant code via private helpers (validation, HTTP, JSON parsing)

## Recent Decisions
- **Evaluator output format**: One message per client_id (not one message with all matches)
  - Enables tenant locality: messages partitioned by client_id
  - Simplifies aggregator: one client per message
  - If alert matches N clients, N messages are published

- **Sender service design**: Multi-channel sender supporting email (SMTP), Slack (Incoming Webhooks), and webhooks (HTTP POST)
  - Queries endpoints table for all endpoint types (email, slack, webhook) by rule_ids
  - Routes to appropriate sender based on endpoint type
  - Email: SMTP protocol with configurable server (defaults to localhost:1025 for local dev)
  - Slack: Incoming Webhooks API with formatted messages and severity-based color coding
  - Webhook: HTTP POST with JSON payload containing full notification details
  - Idempotent: checks status before sending, updates after
  - At-least-once delivery: safe to redeliver (skips if already SENT)
  - Partial failures are logged but don't fail operation if at least one channel succeeds

- **rule-service-ui**: React + Vite UI for rule-service management
  - Full CRUD operations for clients, rules, and endpoints
  - Modern UI with tabbed navigation
  - Connects to rule-service API at http://localhost:8081 (via Vite proxy)
  - Features: create, read, update, delete, toggle enable/disable for all entities
  - Optimistic locking support for rule updates (version field)

- **Centralized Infrastructure Management**: Created unified dependency management
  - Root `docker-compose.yml` for shared infrastructure (Postgres, Kafka, Redis, Zookeeper)
  - Centralized verification script (`scripts/infrastructure/verify-dependencies.sh`)
  - Centralized migration runner (`scripts/migrations/run-migrations.sh`)
  - Centralized Kafka topic creation (`scripts/infrastructure/create-kafka-topics.sh`)
  - Services should verify dependencies, NOT manage them
  - `make run-all` automatically starts infrastructure if not running (one-command startup)
  - See `docs/architecture/INFRASTRUCTURE.md` for full documentation

- **Security: Email Credentials**: Removed all hardcoded email credentials from documentation
  - Replaced hardcoded Gmail credentials in `GMAIL_SETUP.md`, `README.md`, and `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` with placeholders
  - Created `.env.example` template file for secure credential management
  - Code already uses environment variables correctly (no code changes needed)
  - All credentials must now be provided via environment variables or `.env` file
  - `.env` files are already in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits

- **UI Integration for alert-producer (Planned)**: Integration with rule-service-ui for alert generation
  - HTTP API wrapper around alert-producer functionality
  - New UI component in rule-service-ui for generating alerts
  - Support for all CLI configuration options via web interface
  - Real-time status monitoring and job tracking
  - Preset configurations and manual configuration options
  - See `services/alert-producer/memory-bank/` for detailed design

- **Protobuf Integration (Complete)**: All Kafka topics migrated from JSON to protobuf
  - Created protobuf definition files (`proto/` directory):
    - `common.proto`: Shared enums (Severity, RuleAction)
    - `alerts.proto`: AlertNew and AlertMatched messages
    - `rules.proto`: RuleChanged message
    - `notifications.proto`: NotificationReady message
  - Generated Go code in `pkg/proto/` with proper module setup
  - All 6 services migrated to use protobuf serialization:
    - alert-producer: publishes AlertNew with proto.Marshal
    - evaluator: consumes AlertNew, publishes AlertMatched
    - aggregator: consumes AlertMatched, publishes NotificationReady
    - rule-service: publishes RuleChanged
    - rule-updater: consumes RuleChanged
    - sender: consumes NotificationReady
  - Enhanced tooling (added 2026-01):
    - Makefile targets: `proto-generate`, `proto-validate`, `proto-lint`, `proto-breaking`, `proto-verify-generated`
    - Buf configuration (`buf.yaml`) for linting and breaking change detection
    - Verification script to ensure generated code stays current
    - GitHub Actions workflow for CI validation
    - Pre-commit hooks for local validation
    - CI Fix (2026-01-21): Improved buf detection in Makefile to work with GitHub Actions buf-action by using `which` instead of `command -v`
  - Severity enum alignment (2026-01-21):
    - Fixed severity type mismatch between protobuf enums and database strings
    - Changed protobuf enum values to match database format directly: `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, `CRITICAL` (removed `SEVERITY_` prefix)
    - In Go: `pbcommon.Severity_LOW`, `.String()` returns `"LOW"` - direct match with database
    - Simpler code: no conversion helpers needed, single source of truth
    - This ensures rule matching works correctly (was causing "No rules matched alert" errors)
  - Comprehensive documentation:
    - Strategy: `docs/architecture/PROTOBUF_INTEGRATION_STRATEGY.md`
    - Tooling: `docs/architecture/PROTOBUF_TOOLING.md`
    - Usage guide: `proto/README.md`
  - Benefits: Binary serialization, type safety, schema evolution, reduced message size
